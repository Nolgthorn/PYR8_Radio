# PYR8_Radio
## The Rundown
This is a personal project to create a basic audio player using python and SQLite.

## Current State
So far this repository only includes a couple of features for creating and populating the database with song data.

## Files
### AutoDataCollect.py
Digs through a targetted directory to locate all files with a given file extension and insert each file into the database along with the scraped metadata.

### dirCrawlr.py
Module with various directory crawling functions for locationg and retrieving files and their paths.
This module is required by 'AutoDataCollect.py' and currently must be stored in the same directory to be imported.
